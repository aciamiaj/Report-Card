# Report-Card

The Report Card Application is a Java program designed to compute and generate a report card for students based on their assignment scores, lab scores, and test scores. This program allows users to enter the necessary scores and calculates the overall percentage and total grade for each student.

How to Use
Open the Java file named MainApp.java in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor.

Locate the main method within the MainApp class and run the program.

The program will prompt you to enter the required scores for assignments, labs, and tests.

Follow the instructions and input the scores when prompted. Ensure that the scores are within the valid range specified.

Once all the scores have been entered, the program will calculate the overall percentage and total grade for the student.

The generated report card will be displayed, showing the student's name, course, assignment scores, lab scores, test scores, overall percentage, and total grade.

After the report card is displayed, you will be asked if you want to compute another set of grades. Enter "yes" to repeat the process or "no" to exit the program.

The program will continue to run as long as you choose to compute another set of grades.

Input Validation
The Report Card Application includes input validation to ensure that the scores entered are within the valid range. The following rules apply:

Assignment scores must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 20.
Lab scores must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10.
Test scores must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100.
If any of the entered scores violate these rules, an appropriate error message will be displayed, and the program will exit.
